There had been many Tusker hands that had taken a part in destroying Martine.  The name still sounded strange to me, an echo of a remembrance of a dream.  Some memories had come back, though.  Enough for me to know that most of what had been Martine was lost.  Now there was only me.  \n"

I almost started trembling, but controlled it.  Part of my training had been spent on mastering my fear.  I would be useless in combat if I panicked.\n"

Little wisps of air, blowing from point to point, fighting over grains of sand.  We saw the caution of your kind, lesser, when the herald of the Nameless was let loose on the world.  And if we hadn't stepped in?  Lucky for the humans that the Directive had other plans for Auberean.\n"
