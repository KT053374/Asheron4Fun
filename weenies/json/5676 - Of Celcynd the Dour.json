Celcynd was the first to master Empyrean planar magic.  It failed him at a critical point, however.  When Holtburg was under siege by Tumeroks, he cast a portal which allowed the children to escape.  It consumed so much mana, however, that he was unable to cast a second portal in time to rescue the adults.  He sank into his guilt, and even the love of Brentsella was not enough to bring him out of it for long.\n"
