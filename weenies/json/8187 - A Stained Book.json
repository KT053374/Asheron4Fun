Other scholars may accuse me of imaginative fancy, but they assuredly have not seen all that I have.\n"

What that purpose is, even I can only hazard the most unfounded of guesses.  What is clear, however, is that they forgot this purpose over the long ages.  Some Isparian scholars would claim the same of humanity in general, but I am not in the mood for comparative theological discourse today.\nIn any case, I find these city corridors somewhat useful for my travels; the portals leading from here frequently seem to take me closer to civilization.\n"
