One of these settlements is Greenspire, a town built around the remnants of a great Empyrean lighthouse. In Thistledown of 16 PY, as part of Varrici II's war against the \"Bloodless,\" the three human settlements on Marae were captured under cover of night. Though a fragile truce now exists between Strathelar and Varrici, the three spire towns remain under New Viamont's control."
