During the Dark times, when all of the children of Ispar were slaves made to toil under the heavy yoke of Olthoi oppression, there truly was no hope of overcoming our taskmasters.  So, Zenzaburou Vanten the Archmage (note: then the Quick.  How times change...), and Vesayen Hylin gathered together to plan.\n"

The Olthoi were capable of anticipating the actions of any slave with crystalline clarity, and had foiled many different escape attempts by coordinating their movements as if guided by one mind.  It seemed as if all the things that Zenzaburou had talked about would never come to fruition when a strange earthquake occurred.  After the rocks had finished shifting, and the tunnels had been flooded with dust, they decided to act.  They quickly organized the other slaves, guiding them away from their Olthoi taskmasters under the cover of darkness.\n"

There were in fact many slaves that were simply too scared to move or talk, unless prodded by one of their masters.  Fear is a powerful tool.\n"

The jungle was not without its inherent dangers, and the savage mosswarts and brutish predators succeeded in claiming some of our numbers regardless of Zenzaburou and Vanten's best efforts.  This lack of safety resulted in some of the people leaving, for they felt they could ensure their continued well being far more than Zenzaburou could.  They have not been heard from in some time, but there are those amongst us that still believe they live, further in the Vesayen Isles.\n"
