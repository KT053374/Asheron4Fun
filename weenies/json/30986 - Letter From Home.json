He knows full well that our defense is but a show. Should he choose to press his attack, I fear that the Malika's glorious army will fall like wheat to the scythe. \n\nI know not what lies beyond the portal you have chosen to take. Perhaps a life of joy and peace; perhaps not. Whatever lies out there, I wish you luck. This old world is too full of death and pain. You deserve better than that."
