We have had some success using this infusion to empower items, but are still in the experimental stages.\n\n... \n\nUnfortunately, this process seems to have also awakened the Elementals and Magma Golems in the deeper steam vents near the Ley Line, which has forced us to lock off the lower tunnels during the times when the infusion is distilling, and sending units of Sclavus to collect the Infusions once they are complete.\n"

If we reach a juncture where the research necessitates working with the Ley Line directly, we will scour the tunnels clean at that time.\n\n... \n\nIn time, I believe this infusion may provide us a means to strengthen the Rituals to summon our great Lord from the depths, and allow his great Blight to spread amongst the surface world once more.  I will send updates once we have them.  Patriarchs bless and keep you until then.\n"
