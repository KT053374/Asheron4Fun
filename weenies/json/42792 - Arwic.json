Once a prosperous mining village and a bustling center of commerce, Arwic was destroyed by Shadow Spires during the Fourth Sending of Darkness. It has since been rebuilt and is now a fortified city surrounded by sturdy, stone walls. Adventurers looking to translate the writings of the Burun should visit Aun Laokhe, located at the top of the town's central tower."
