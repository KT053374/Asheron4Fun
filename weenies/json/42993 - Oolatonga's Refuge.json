One such tusker is Oolutanga, a test subject of the rogue Virindi Aerbax. Oolutanga was gifted with incredible strength and size, magic, and intellect. He used his new abilities to escape from Aerbax's laboratory, and he fled across the sea to Aphus Lassel. Eventually, other tuskers were freed from the Virindi, and they live with their human worshipers in Oolutanga's Refuge."
