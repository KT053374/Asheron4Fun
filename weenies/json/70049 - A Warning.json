When you and your father began your rebellion, my heart was cleaved in twain. I am a member of the house of Bellenesse. But more importantly, I am a soldier in the King's army.\n\nWhich is what makes this letter so hard to write."

And now that he has, he plans to lead you to your death.\n\nHe is supposedly leading you to a man who bears a portal gem to the King's private chambers, is he not? I tell you, this is a lie. Loc is leading you to your death. The King will be there along with a dozen knights and mages. They will trap you and kill you."

He is poison, and he will find some way to kill you if you let him live.\n\nDo not tell your uncle of this letter. Do not tell anyone. Writing this letter is a betrayal of my oaths to the King. But I simply cannot watch as my dearest cousin is led to her doom by my bitterest rival.\n\nHeed my words, cousin."
