The cave sits in the lowlands just south of the road that runs west out of town, at 41.8N 32.0E.\n\nSome folks go up there looking for loot that might have been left behind. It's rumored that one of Brogord's axes ended up there. The cave is also used by the Explorer Society these days. But beware of the Shreth pack that moved in!\n"
