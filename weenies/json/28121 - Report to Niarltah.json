There were no beings that thought like it, could call to it or ask it for guidance. So it pulled two seeds from the nether and planted each into the soil of the Bur. It watched as the seeds grew into life and began to swim through the muck of the Bur and then leap from the muck to the muloo or walk amongst the iallootu. Brothers born of its flesh, the Fiazhat and the Burun.\n"
