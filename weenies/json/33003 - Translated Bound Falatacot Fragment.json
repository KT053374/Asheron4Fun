Where did this callow hedge-sorcerer learn the arts of summoning, manifestation, and binding? His methods are crude and graceless, like a hovel constructed of unshaped logs. But his work is strong enough to hold me against my will and to subject me to the iniquities of physicality. He has been coached well, but his lessons are incomplete."

Humiliating as my captivity has become, at least I have not had the final indignity of having my mind stripped against my will. As it is, I feed him worthless information when the pain becomes too great. All this, I remember and record. All deeds will be accounted for in the turning of the Wheel of All Things."

        "pageText": "Dardante wants to know about Grael. He wants to know how Grael came about his power, and how one might find him. He has learned enough to become a danger to himself and to those around him. He has not learned enough to realize that he is dancing around the Abyss. My laughter enrages him, and I have not yet seen fit to tell him why I find his queries so amusing. How could he know how many lifetimes were wasted pursuing knowledge of the Black Spear of the Kemeroi? I have fed him useless morsels that will only whet his hunger for Grael. I have led him to believe that a man-thing like him may achieve the same power as Grael, without making the same dark bargain that Grael made."
