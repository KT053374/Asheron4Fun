        "pageText": "\nI, Alatar Locke, have traveled far over these lands called Dereth.  Here I provide a simple guide to the ruins called the Festival Stones, the twenty tall pillars scattered across the face of Dereth, adorned with roiling blue magic.  I judge them to be relics of the late High Empyrean culture; perhaps they are markers of seasonal celebrations.  In any case, the search for all twenty is a taxing endeavor, which only the strongest can endure, and for such have I written.\n"

This, of course, supports my theory that the desert was once lush and fertile.\n"

This Stone, to the west of Rithwic, is ringed by Empyrean statues.\n\nThe Stone of Verdantine stands tall over the road leading southwest out of Samsur, near 3.5S, 15.7E.\n"

This Stone appears in the bare grasslands, and even the most inept should be able to find it.\n"

There is a minor peasant community nearby.\n\nThe Stone of Snowreap is tucked away in the caldera of the great volcano we call Mount Esper, at 65.3N, 13.3E.  Judging by the ruins found at this location, it was once a sizable Empyrean town.  I theorize that the Empyrean refined Pyreal in the fiery core of Mount Esper, but of this I have as yet no evidence.\n"

This stone is at the tip of a long, narrow peninsula between two islands.  Alas, even I could not find a place to scale the sheer cliffs of the islands.\n"

I would suggest that this was once near a port of some sort, since fallen to ruin.  Perhaps this stone was erected for festivals to appease the forces of the sea and sky.\n"
