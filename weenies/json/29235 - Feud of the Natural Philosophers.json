Ishaq is a nice old coot - always ready to welcome strangers - and if you have any questions about the mating habits of shreth or how an ursuin teaches her young to hunt, he's your man! That is, if he can find his notes. Ishaq has some problems with his memory. In fact, if you're headed out that way you should stop in and see him. He almost always needs help with something or other.\n\n"
