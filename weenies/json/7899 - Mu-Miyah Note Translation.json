The hidden lords of Dericost had their hands deep into our people then. In the subjugation of us, they came to respect and admire our warriors. It once was said that, man for man, none could best the nomads of the high desert.\n"

It was always a strange thought to us that anyone could do any less than whatever is necessary to achieve victory. I have also heard it said that, because we had always lived on the move, we were far better at raiding and fast-moving warfare.\n"

As more of our chieftains proved their loyalty to the Ice Throne, more were blest with conversion to Mu-Miyah, the only form of thinking-death in which the body does not decay at all, but is well and truly eternal. In time, we commanded all the finest companies of Dericost.\n"

At Harebach Crose, I captured the standard of  Relmontaine, and was highly praised by Ilkanne herself. At Berkesh I fought the Yalain captain Machus Sencara in single combat, and brought back his head to hang from our company's standard. The skull still hung there on the morning we fought at the foot of Gelid.\n"

We would hold them off easily.\n"

The skin of the lesser thinking-dead cracked and broke away as they marched. For hours, all I could grasp of the battle was the sound. Men and women screamed in pain and fury, the metal clashed and clanked, support arms whirred and whistled, and mage-fire crackled.\n"

There among the snow and battle stood a woman clad in white, with long golden hair spilling over her shoulders. With the tip of a flaming silver sword she drew a circle around herself, and coolly smote any Firstborn who dared cross it. I stood among the great captains, beneath our proud banners, and watched her.\n"

She did not seem to notice. She was splendid to watch, so graceful and untiring she seemed inhuman. I have rarely seen one outside our own tribes so completely devoted to the warrior's arts, and none of us could withstand her. She was, I later learned, Leikotha, an esteemed chevaird of Haebrous. At the time, however, all I heard of her was Nerash's murmur, \"She is beautiful, is she not?\" Of course, we all know how that story ended.\n"

The Kings had gone with the Lords to Killiakta, joining the Winds in their hidden redoubts. By the time atonement had come, our descendants had been taught by Yalaini missionaries to think of us as they did.\n"
