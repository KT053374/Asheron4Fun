Once her body was delivered to the Duke of Bellenesse, that war came to a close. But the end of that war did not erase the tension that exists between the Loyalists of Sanamar and the Rebels of Silyun. Rumor has it that the Grand Knight of Sanamar and the Grand Mother of Silyun seek the assistance of all who would aid them in this cold, silent conflict."
