Though the shifting staircases proved to be a conundrum when I first arrived, I have now mastered the ascent and know each landing by rote. As I made my way to the top, I discovered there were three sections to this library, and each section seemed to be devoted to recording the rise of an Empyrean civilization. The shelves within these sections are most disturbing, as it seems each one contains a trapped soul. Were such an atrocity not of their own doing, I would perhaps feel pity\n"
