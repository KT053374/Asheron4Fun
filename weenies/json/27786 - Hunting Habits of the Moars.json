The notes mention that they hunted alone for their usual prey, but when bigger prey is present they were known to form impromptu packs. The book comments on the ability of the Moar to hunt and kill creatures that sound very similar to the Burun we have seen appearing in our swamplands,\n"

These Moarsmen would forgo most of their apprehension to working with others in the interest of a free meal.\n"
