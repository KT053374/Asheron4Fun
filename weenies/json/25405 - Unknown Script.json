I traced the roots of the language to Dericost, but the derivatives are inconsistent with Dericost standards. If the book hadn't been destroyed I may have been able to get more.\n\nAccording to the small amount that I was able to decipher it appears that the book's title is, \"Song Breath Life\" or perhaps \"Way Song Death\". The only word that I was able\n"
