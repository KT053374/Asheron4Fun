But I count myself thankful for that fateful day when I encountered the 16th. They who had fought and lost so much, still welcomed us to join their retreat. \nI cannot in truth say I ever had the strength to stomach their work as Mercenaries, but that too has changed. I no not where he has traveled to; only that this land is not of Ispar and though we may give it such a name, this world will lead us down a different path. I digress however, it is these portals that intrigue me most of all. We find ourselves on an island, alone and outnumbered. It is not a lack of faith I have in Captain bounder and his men, but of concern for this family we have built that I must find the secret to this magic. There must be a way, we have traveled through the portals once and we can do so again I am sure.\nI long for the resources of Therethas. The beloved Imperial Academy of Magic. Truly a Tragedy the siege had been. "
