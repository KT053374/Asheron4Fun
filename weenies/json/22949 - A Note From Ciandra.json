The architecture, the ancient decorations, the Guardians themselves -- these things are a window into the vanished past. Even the sales brochures that the Guardians hand to you when you enter are filled with valuable clues that can help us to unravel the mysteries of our predecessors here on Dereth. \n\nThe most fascinating thing about these Temples, of course, is the transformational mechanisms contained within. It's unclear \n"

These gems are similar in function to the 'skill gems' created by the ancients, except that they work to modify our underlying attributes -- our strength and so forth. They are not as efficient as the skill gems -- I am afraid that you can only bolster one attribute at the expense of another. In addition, you can only modify the innate level of the attribute -- not any levels that you have built up through the experience of living. \n"

I believe that giving the body some time to recover between uses, however, will minimize this.\n\nBelow, I have summarized instructions on both types of gems. We must be prepared to meet the future, whatever it brings, and these gems may provide assistance in that.\n"

You may not have too many skills specialized at once -- although note that it is not the number of skills that is a limitation so much as it is the combined difficulty of those skills.
