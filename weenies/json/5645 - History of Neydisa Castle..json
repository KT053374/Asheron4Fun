Foster, then a new arrival, had been fleeing the Olthoi for days when he glimpsed these spires in the distance.  Initially elated, his joy turned to deep disappointment when he found the walls undefended and no one within.  He spent years hiding here in the towers until the liberation came, and thereafter vowed to never return to such a forsaken place.\n\n"

They took up residence within the Bandit Castle, but some disagreement split their ranks, and a number of them trekked down the road and wound up here, at Foster's Fort.  A woman called simply Neydisa led their ranks.  She saw a grand palace in what looked otherwise like a ruined husk.\n\n"

People now call it Neydisa Castle.  We who live here keep to ourselves.  We seek to live in peace and simplicity.  We have no need to venture beyond our walls, for we have all that we need within.\n"
