As mages scrambled to explain the dropping temperatures, the snowline dipped down from the lofty peaks of the Lost Wish and Linvak mountain ranges, until the entire island was coated with several inches of snow. Even the Gharu'ndim, deep in the hot and barren A'mun desert, awoke one morn to find their stately brick courtyards blanketed with white. In Samsur, the Fountain of Musansayn froze solid. \n"

Intrepid bands followed his meandering path from Arwic to Stonehold, gathering clues to his final destination.\n"

In the deepest caverns, parties were brought up short by a cadre of Gelidite Lords led by the powerful sorcerer Frisirth.
