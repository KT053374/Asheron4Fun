We made sure to only recruit those who have proven their loyalty to the rebels of Silyun. Now that we have obtained samples, we can proceed with our plans. Soon, we will be able to sabotage the Viamontians' research, and perhaps retaliate in kind against the murderer Varicci."

The lessons they learned in their years of fighting for survival in the Halaetans are invaluable. I expect that the guidance of Tharnoch and his soldiers will help turn the tide against the Viamontian assault on Dereth."

Double your guard at the Silyun Chapterhouse, and be suspicious of all newcomers. We may actually be able to turn this situation to our advantage, though it requires that you and your garrison serve as a sort of trap."

        "pageText": "Since the Silyun chapterhouse is so well fortified, and since none of our important research takes place there, it might be useful to allow some infiltrators to attempt to enter the compound. You will likely need Hashina's cooperation in this, to direct Viamontian spies your way. She would be a likely contact point for any potential infiltrators. Should any of Varicci's spies enter your domain, you have my permission to capture them and glean from them whatever information you can."
