It seems that a lone swordsman, hunting mosswarts in the Blackmire west of Sawato, came across a huge ruined keep inhabited by Sclavus. Nearby, to the northeast, an unusual granite cave thrust up from the ground. In this cave he found a green stone of unusual quality. It is said that a  mage of some ability examined the stone, and determined it to have several enchantments upon it. What these were, and how to activate them, he could not discern.\n"
