The screams of the gulls increase as more of them find their morning meal amongst the darting silvery flashes of fish.  The man watches his daughter watch the docks and the ocean behind it.  As much as he enjoys the sights of the harbor at dawn, he enjoys her pleasure more.  Every day is a delight to her, bringing to her young mind something fresh and exhilarating.\n"

The shopkeeper smiles, says hello to the father and his daughter, and produces another piece of salt taffy for the child.   The man knows that Melanay will gently scold him for Aritta's developing sweet tooth, but looking at the excitement in her eyes, how can he say no?\n"
