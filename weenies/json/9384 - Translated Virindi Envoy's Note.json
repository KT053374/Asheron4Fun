Despite the humans' persecution of their kind, the leaders of their race will attempt to make some overtures to their fellow flesh-puppets.  A group of renegades, who have control of deposits of the anti-magical mineral, are rebelling against their misguided leaders, just as we have done.\n\n"

We still find this emphasis on physicality to be novel and unsettling, but it is important to consider proximity.  Make contact with the renegades and negotiate with them.  Secure further deliveries of the anti-magic mineral, and offer them assistance in breaching the walls of their mountain fastness.\n\n--Speaker of the New Directive\n\n"
