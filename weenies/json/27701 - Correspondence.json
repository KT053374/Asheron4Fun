As such we have been forced to rely on our ability to mix the different herbs and stones of the world to create ointments and bandages that will assist in curing our wounds. The kits we have included within this chest are some of the best kits to heal wounds we have. They will not cure the most grievous wounds, but they will heal you even when your concentration wanes due to blood loss.\n"
