Leading a caravan of like-minded Sho and Gharu'ndim, the noble settled near the Darktide Festival Stone, and established the town of Ayan Baqur. Rather quickly, a group of Aluvians arrived, driven by the overcrowding in Arwic. Among this group was Ulgrim the Unpleasant, a discredited scholar. While Ulgrim's stout-fueled rants entertained many, few believed a word he spoke.\n"

The Lady had been in a deep depression since the death of Sir Joffre Tremblant in Frore. Hence, her decision to take on the untrustworthy Gormling may be forgiven. Like Ulgrim, the seneschal couldn't hold his drink. Worse, he was discovered to be an agent of her rival, the bandit MacDougal. Tallial, who spent her days staring wretchedly at mementos Tremblant had left her, seemed oblivious to her peril.\n"

Many were promptly stolen by Drudges seeking shiny objects, and eventually passed on to more powerful monsters. Other new weapons were discovered by adventurers afield; a cursed dagger and electrical throwing daggers belonging to the elusive assassin Oswald. Again, the crafty rogue managed to evade his pursuers.\n"

When some Tenebrous Edge initiates came to see him, they discovered he had been transformed into a Shadow creature, and barely able to speak. \"I am unable to leave my chambers in this ancient, cursed fortress,\" he had written his daughter. \"I know now what will become of me. The Dark Master himself spoke to me and told me what lies in store... what awaits me now surpasses even the depraved rites of the Milantans.\" Alone and tormented, the entity that had been Hamud stoically awaited his fate.\n"
