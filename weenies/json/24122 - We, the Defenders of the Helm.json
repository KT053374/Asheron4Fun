These creatures fight with ferocity and cunning unmatched. The Dericost, who were formidable foes, were not half as potent or efficient as these monstrosities. Though we are all too young to have known the bite of the faceless ones that stormed the surface of this world only to be repelled by the Lightbringer, we have wagered that even they were not as fearsome.\n"
