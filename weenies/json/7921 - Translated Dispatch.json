Each piece was, in some sense, under the control of the Servant. For this reason, each attempted to dig itself into the ground upon coming to rest. Doubtless this was an attempt to evade the detection of his captors. One of these pieces was thrown as far as Aerlinthe, and the Lady Aerfalle observed soldiers of Yalain recover and send it oversea. We believe this was the core piece that was found sealed in the Nexus facility, where the component pieces of the array were grown in the first place.\n"

It was later found by a small group of our descendants, and their experiments on it ultimately led to their destruction, and the present crisis.\n"

This decimation of the enemy's forces, when combined with the loss of the Servant, effectively ended the war. The mass of their power in the world was penned, and much of the remainder destroyed.\n"

How they accomplished this, and where they have been in the meantime, remain open questions. There is no question that they have returned. The recent sport they\n"

It is still blackened and barren, with only that repulsive fungus able to survive. The ash stirs restlessly in the breeze, and the rumbling of magical thunder can be heard even in clear daylight. The currents of mana in the area are still profoundly disturbed. However, with careful study, my comrades have been able to isolate certain magical harmonics in the peculiar, humming crystals created by the explosion.\n"

My studies into the geomancy of the ancient Falatacot proved quite fruitful here. We have, to be brief, been able to use harmonics of the crystals in the wasteland to discern the approximate locations of an additional three pieces of the array, by divining their telltale aural vibrations. They would seem to have been locked in special storage facilities, deeply buried in the earth and protected from detection by various magical wards. The Yalain never possessed much ability at geomancy, so I doubt that these are decoy facilities.\n"
