The glowering volcanic face of Rez'arel and pale, mysterious Alb'arel rose again in their courses.\n\nHumanity began to rebuild after the violence of the previous month, even as the Shadow Spires that had wrought the destruction began to dig themselves back into the earth whence they had come. In Arwic, the Environmental Defense League respectfully buried the smoldering remains town's beloved heifer, Sally. In Tufa, the residents stoically rebuilt their shops on ledges around the rim of the crater.\n"

Explorers had recently discovered this network of caves under the sands between Al-Arqas and Khayyaban. The facility was a former Empyrean archive. The scholars of Zaikhal carted thousands of books out of the lower caves for study. The first fruits of their research were the so-called \"peas,\" a Yalaini method of storing magic reagents in a compact form. Ibn Raymar's party colonized the upper caves, though the lower regions remained dark and overrun by creatures. Rumor held that a valuable aid to enchanters could be found in the lower\n"

Explorers venturing into the rugged Linvak Mountains were stunned to find an enormous fortress under construction by Lugians. Some mages feared that its massive walls must be made of chorizite, and began wailing to their respective gods that the structure be struck down by one of the increasingly rare shooting stars.\n"

Unfortunately, Sir Martine seemed to have been abducted by some other group at that point, for only his journal was found among the Mosswarts. By the end of the month, no further clues to his location had been found. \n"

This structure, constructed within the wilds of portalspace, drifted wantonly through that strange violet-lit realm.

He opined that the city had been built at the height of the Seaborne Empire of Yalain, when portal magic was \"in vogue.\" In time, its enchantments lost potency. The city was cast adrift, fading in and out of contact with the world of Auberean over the millennia.\n"

On Ispar, Harvestgain was, naturally enough, the month of the harvest. Perhaps because of the abundance of scarecrows back home, some of the homely straw men found their way through the vagaries of portalspace. Some reported animated scarecrows harassing travelers, but no reliable witnesses could be found. These tales were dismissed as the work of the kegs barkeeps had rolled out for the harvest festival.\n"

Superstition held that these faces would ward off evil. The Shadows did not seem impressed.\n"

An enterprising Aluvian leathercrafter decided to alter her Kireth gown to allow a bit more . . . ventilation. She offered her skills as a seamstress to others at no charge. To her considerable surprise, she found herself beset both by conservatives, who claimed that the cut of the dress would adversely affect the moral fortitude of Isparians, and liberals, who claimed the cut of the dress denigrated the Aluvian goddess trinity and Queen Elysa Strathelar.\n"
