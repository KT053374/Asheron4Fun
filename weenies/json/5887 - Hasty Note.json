Sir Joffre is ecstatic, and is sure we're on the proper path to find legendary Frore. He believes the Gelidites stopped here while searching for a suitable site for Frore. Why this place was rejected is imponderable - it certainly seems remote enough! The view of the uncouth MacDugal's Castle from here is fabulous. If only we'd brought a skilled artist. On to see Lady Tallial at Neydisa Castle!\n\n"
