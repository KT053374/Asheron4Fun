Ostensibly it is so named because of the ruins of ancient civilizations found there. A garrison of knights has established a small outpost on its eastern shore, which they have named Eastwatch. But even those doughty warriors hesitate to venture into the terrible frozen valley at the northern head of the island, named the Shattered Out-Lands."
