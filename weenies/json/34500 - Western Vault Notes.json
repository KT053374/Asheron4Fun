I even came face to face with a horrifying Falatacot creature named Vizidh. Before the waves of Sclavus forced me to retreat, I did spy a storeroom that seemed to be full of ornate golden goblets, with a Golem already decommissioned by Falatacot attacks. The Falatacot clearly don't want anyone to be able to follow Asheron's trail. I suppose if there is foul play at work in Asheron's long disappearance, we must consider the Falatacot to be the most likely culprits."
