Normally I have no trouble fighting them, but their swarming attacks exhausted me and left me vulnerable, just as their leader caught me unaware with a most painful shot from his crossbow!  After suffering through innumerable trips to the lifestone, trying to recover some of my most precious items, I am giving up.  A good explorer knows to minimize his losses.\n"
