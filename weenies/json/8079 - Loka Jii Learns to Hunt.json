His father was an adventurer of great reknown among the Sho, and young Jii wanted to follow in his father's footsteps. Now, the hunters among us know that the most important aspect of hunting is knowledge -- knowledge of the prey, its haunts, its habits, its strengths, its weaknesses.\n"

So adept was the older Jii at spinning tales, that young Jii easily imagined himself as the hunter, stalking the prey, going in for the kill, and emerging triumphant.\n\nRegrettably, young Jii spent so much time daydreaming of hunting that he would forget to do his chores. Even worse, Jii's daydreams were more about the triumph of victory than of the use of knowledge, skills, and patience. This would be his undoing.\n"

He took his new yaoji, put on an old leather breastplate, leggings and leather boots, and headed north of the Loka farm. Young Jii was confident of victory in the hunt, but not because of his prowess (which he lacked in great amounts; truth to tell, Jii was a small, weak lad). No, young Jii's confidence came from his selection of prey: the wild, dangerous, and vicious black rabbit.\n"

(Indeed, the Jii farm was famous among the rabbit hordes for its succulent cabbages, carrots, apples, and other assorted delights.) In addition to eating the vegetables in the garden, the rabbits bred quickly, and somewhat noisily. Sometimes, during the cool spring nights, the furious rustling in the woods would keep the family awake for hours.\n"

Rabbits were nowhere to be found! He searched near the cabbage garden, in the woods, across the road, and around the farm, but no rabbits. Why?\n"

The noises that he made while walking, quiet though they were, were still loud enough to scare away potential prey.\n\nAt any rate, tired and frustrated, Jii sat down on a nearby rock to rest and think. He imagined himself as the great slayer of rabbits, ridding the farm of the pests forever, and being acclaimed by neighbors and friends. Tired and daydreaming, he fell asleep -- awakening several hours later.\n"

With a great war cry, he sprang forward, and engaged the beast!\n\nThe story of the actual battle is short.\n"
