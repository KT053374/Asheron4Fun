I'm glad to know you're well, and that you haven't lost your sense of humor. The tale of your stay with the undead -- that was hilarious! I was laughing so hard, I had to read it aloud to Borelean; he thought his mother had gone mad!\n\nOh, and it was kind of you to ask after him -- I know well your feelings about children, but let me assure you that Bor is well past the\n"

He reminds me always of his father, but he is already his own person and indeed has already left his own mark on our new world, with more to come as he matures, I know. Asheron says -- but no, I'm sorry. I know how you feel about Asheron also, and I don't want our first correspondence in a decade to annoy you. I remember your annoyed face, with your brow beetled and your mouth puckered, and I have no wish to inflict that image on myself any longer.\n"

And asking if I have used my position to secure romantic engagements -- well, let me just say that I was so incensed by that question that I am considering putting up a monument to you in the middle of Holtburg. Is that threat enough to make you hold your tongue?\n\nAh, but you know that I am joking with you, Alatar. In truth, there is a certain young man ...\n"

I did not mean to become Queen -- but there were things that needed doing, and no one was doing them, and so I did them. And once I had handled the immediate tasks, there were more, and more, and always more, and suddenly I was not just the person doing -- I\n"

I think perhaps that part of the problem arises because I am most visible when there is some trouble, and thus many come to associate me with troubled times. Goodness knows that we have had our share of flamboyant trouble in the past few years. They do not see our efforts -- not mine alone, of course, but the Council's -- to hold us together, to keep our fragile society alight, and to grow it into a place of peace and plentitude for all. \n\nTake this recent bother with the shopkeepers: more recent arrivals tend to consider themselves residents of Dereth all together,\n"

There is no sin in that, of course, but in this parochialism they have chosen to exclude others. Why, it was all I could do to convince the shopkeepers to no longer charge a tax on trade notes from other towns! You would think I had asked for their firstborn! But eventually, reluctantly, they agreed (although even then they raised their prices to compensate, but I still count it a win overall) and so we are one step closer to a united Dereth and -- dare I say it? -- perhaps one day a banking system such as we knew in Ispar.\n"
