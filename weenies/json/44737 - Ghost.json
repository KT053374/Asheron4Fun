Their bodies have long since crumbled away, leaving only a powerful spirit behind. Other ghosts are the tortured souls of Empyreans that now haunt the place where they died. Wherever one finds death on a massive scale in the history of Empyreans, from the volcanic island of Aerfalle to the doomed Dericost house of Mhoire, one will often encounter ghosts."
