As I look up at the two moons overhead, how can this be anything but a dream?  The two moons are only the beginning of the strangeness.\n\nThe mornings...the mornings are cruel, Melanay.  How many blessed dawns did I share with you and Aritta?  It was our time, a time before the work of a day made me tired and quiet\n"

But in light, this place looks little different than our own.  \n"

In light of day, all hope is burned out of me that I am living a dream; a nightmare, true, but one from which one day I could have hoped to wake up.  \n\nBut the sun lets me know that all is real.  That you and Aritta are gone.\n\nAre you safe, my dearest?  Is Aritta?  This is what keeps me awake at night.  Almost, I could find a sad and bitter peace were I \n"

Oh, make sure of it.\n\nI did not want to leave.  There was a...call.  It called to me, Melanay.  It sung.  Sweet, sweet words danced and played in my head as I slept.  I did not have a choice.  I did not...\n"

Asked and pleaded, screamed and begged.  I have asked the soil and the sky, the river and the flames.  \n\nNo one will tell me how to get back to you.\n\nWhen hope has failed, where tears, threats, and rage cannot penetrate, what then?

Now I know it would be best.  A brief time of sharp pain.  And then you could move on.  You could heal.\n\nPerhaps I should die here.  It's hard to contemplate the end of life, the end of sight and sound and knowing, when there is still some chance that I could see you and Aritta again.  But perhaps this is a extraordinary kind of dream, one that requires a extraordinary method of waking from.\n"
