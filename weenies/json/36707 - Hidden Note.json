The thing posing as Kresovus was hiding something in the warrens below Linvak Tukal.\nI snuck in and found the remains of some kind of experiment I believed they performed on Balor. Whatever it was they skinned him to do it. I killed the Watcher in the Warrens guarding the old entrance to the Trials of the Arm, Mind and Heart, but a powerful Virindi Experimenter wounded me badly. I was able to escape and hide beneath a blocked passage in the Trial rooms, but my recalls and ties no longer work. It would appear I am trapped down here. I fear that I may not return to headquarters when I expire. If you find this message you should already have the proof we need to get Queen Elysa to move against the imposter. My only regret is I never found what happened to Lord Kresovus.\n"
