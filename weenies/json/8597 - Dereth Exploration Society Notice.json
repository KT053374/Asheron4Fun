We have, however, been frustrated by the peculiar magicks of the stones. It seems that agents of the remaining Gelidites have enchanted them such that a transcription of their text may only be made once a week by a given person. Our intial surveyor thus lost a precious Dericost Seal here. Perhaps the intention was to keep humanity out of Frore's tunnels. All it has accomplished is to ensure that a party must seek out all three stones, and arrive at Frore in numbers."
