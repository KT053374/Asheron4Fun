Small groups of Shadows could still be found wandering the landscape, but their army, and their generals, remained sight unseen. Many began to wonder what the enemy was planning, if anything. Some optimists insisted that the dark ones had forgotten about this world, and gone on the bigger conquests elsewhere.\n"

They were not the only creatures busy, however, as the massive Lugians discovered an ore with unique properties in the Linvak Mountains to the south. Soon they had opened three mines to recover this \"Chorizite,\" which appeared to be conventional metal that had somehow been rendered magically \"dead,\" and could not be affected by enchanters. When humanity discovered this marvelous material, the workers quickly found themselves overrun with eager would-be miners.\n"

Refined and forged, it could make weapons capable of piercing all protective enchantments to self and armor, although these weapons also shrugged off all manner of arcane enhancement. Ground, it could be used as a reagent by mages. As a result of Chorizite's unique properties, spells that used powdered Chorizite were able to dispel enchantments on their target. Distilled, the ore could be used in Alchemy, allowing those skilled in this art to make drinkable potions that could dispel low-level\n"

The crypt of Mi Krau-Li, one of the most famous users of the Sho jitte weapon (some said he was the ONLY user) was found empty. A note found nearby complained that he had been buried alive, and had gone off to complete his work. Explorers did later find Krau-Li, quite dead and half-decayed, but still maintaining that he was alive. In exchange for the return of one of his older jittes, he offered the reward of his newly developed \"improved\" jitte.\n"

The giant Lugians took this \"innovation\" one step further. Young Lugian hooligans were soon to be found bashing each other with bigger boards, and bigger nails.\n"

Many fossilized undead skeletons still wandered the island, as did a host of bizarre new creatures. Coral golems lined the navigation channel into the lagoon. Tenuous vapor and plasma golems roamed the calderas of the volcanoes and the underground.\n"

Perhaps this was due to the fierce conditions in the crater, or perhaps because what commanded the occupying forces could not be easily discerned.\n"
