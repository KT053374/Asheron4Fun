Near the city, she found a Temple of the Dragon of Power beside the road.  At the time, Koji mistrusted the Dragon of Power, for everyone taught how fickle the Dragon was, but she stopped at the Temple to rest for the night anyway.\n"

The Dragon now gives you a portion of the Dragon's own Power, as a test of your Discipline.\"\n"

Along the way, she came to a mountain.  She could not go around, for to either side were rivers, and so she had to climb.  As the noonday sun beat down upon her, the voice of the Bairyuu said, \"Call now for your Power, little Koji.  With Power, you could soon leap over this small hill and be on your way.\"\n"

Thus Koji showed her own Humility.\n\nThen Koji was walking along the river.  Along the way, she saw a tree ripe with delicious-looking apples across the water.  But the water was too swift for fording.  Then the voice of Bairyuu said, \"Call now for your Power, little Koji.  With Power, you could soon leap over the water and take those apples.\"\n"
