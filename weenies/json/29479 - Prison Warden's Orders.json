If my spies are to be believed, he is as legendary an infiltrator and killer on this world as he was on the previous one. He seems, in fact, to have picked up even more talents. But do make sure he is held there until I can visit and interview him myself. I would dearly love to know how exactly he wormed through our defenses at the royal castle back in Viamont. I would also like to know if he has any remaining ties to the wretched Bellenesse."
