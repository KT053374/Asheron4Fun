I simply cannot believe her soldiers are this inept.\n \nYou are to scout the hills around Stonehold. If we are to make meaningful progress into Dereth, we will need to take this town. You would be wise to approach it with caution, however. We cannot expect another victory as simple as that of Marae Lassel."
