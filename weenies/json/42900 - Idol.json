Although confined to his crystalline prison, no doubt some of Bael'Zharon's presence leaked into the surrounding lands, tainting the isles with his evil. In proof, many of the isles' Idols, strange totemic figures carven to resemble Dereth's creatures, seemed to possess a secret, hidden life-force of their own. Such Idols felled many an explorer who believed they had overcome all odds to reach a hidden treasure -- only to have one of these towering creations come bursting to life! "
