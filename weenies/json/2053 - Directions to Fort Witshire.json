Hence, a man named Witshire built a fort upon the ruins of an Empyrean fortress, out to the west of Cragstone.  Fort Witshire stood tall and proud for but a short time, for the tumeroks were driven back, and it was soon abandoned.  Now it stands alone, out to the west of Cragstone in the fields.\n\n"
