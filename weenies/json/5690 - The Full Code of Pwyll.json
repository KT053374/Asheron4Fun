But we, as knights, shall take the high road.\"  - High King Pwyll\n\nIt is to the great sorrow of the historians that so few texts have been brought over from Aluvia, our homeland.  Hence here we present Instructions on the Code of High King Pwyll, a primer to be used by those of good understanding to instruct those of who have not been given a firm grounding in these just and true rules.\n"

The second Five are the Path of High Justice, which are to be observed by all those of noble or knightly bearing, in addition to the Five rules of Low Justice.  For those who have little are capable of little; those who have much are capable of much.  But lest a knight be made too proud by his station and possessions, he must remember that Kings show favor to those who prove themselves capable of much, even if they seem to be lacking in gifts.  For that which makes a man great are things not always visible to the eye.\n"

The rules should be engraved upon his heart and mind, and upon the very sinews of his arm.  Justice is the finest of all blades, when tempered with wisdom and the Code of High King Pwyll.\n"
