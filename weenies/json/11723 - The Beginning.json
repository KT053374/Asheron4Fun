Much of what I have planned for Dereth requires secrecy and subtlety, a deft and quiet touch on the pulse of the world.  I do not have confidence that the majority of Isparians are willing to go where I want to take them.  So better that I do not ask.\n"

I hope you enjoy them as much as I did.   \n\nChapter 1 -- Puppet, can be acquired from a new friend of mine, Ketnan, in the remains of Arwic.  I may have overdone my persuasion some, so he may be a touch skittish.  I felt bad for him, so I have allowed him to sell my work for money.  \n"

As some of you may recall, I had some unfortunate experiences there some time ago, and I was not eager to return.  I have left a token that is the essence of my time there.\n"
