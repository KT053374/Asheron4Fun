It became their tomb; the undead Gelidites and the frigid temperatures within slew them to a man. For a time, Sir Tremblant was ensorcelled and changed to a shambling, muttering corpse. Bold adventurers followed in his footsteps, and freed his captive soul. If you seek to as well, search the heights east of the Bandit Castle for a Standing Stone monolith. Be warned; you must be a powerful adventurer to enter the City!\n"
