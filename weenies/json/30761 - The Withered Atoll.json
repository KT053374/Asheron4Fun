My fellow explorers and I were doing that which we do best - exploring - when we came upon a small peninsula west of Candeth Keep. Previously, this peninsula had been populated with the scattered sorts of creatures which typically inhabit that area of the world. My fellows and I used to spend time on the peninsula's coast admiring the view of the Singularity Caul. However, a tribe of religious fanatics recently took up residence there.\n"

I say \"appear to be comprised of\" because my fellows and I were quite hastily dispatched by the creatures when we discovered their encampment.\n"
