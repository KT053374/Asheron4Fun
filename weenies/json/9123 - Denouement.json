The ideals that used to be his inspiration: his family, his friends, safety and peace for all, now become mere stepping stones towards achieving defeat of his enemies.

There must have been some point, some crucial decision or conversation or action which, if having traveled a different path, no tragedy need have occurred.  But then I remember that such musings are pointless.  Stories are not reality.  Still, sometimes I find myself, having read a particularly sad tale, wanting to confront the author, and tell him, \"You did not have to have it end this way.  You could have had the characters live happily ever after.  It was in your power.\" \n"

They actually made him stronger, powerful...puissant is not an inaccurate term.  Oh, I imagine there was pain in the process.  Much pain, if I am not mistaken.
