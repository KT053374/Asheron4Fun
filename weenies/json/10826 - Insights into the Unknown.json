Only now has the disease of thought-chaos begun to strike me, as well, and for this we can only blame the leaders of the New Singularity movement.  Still, I believe I can hold to my mission and keep myself from becoming lost to the taint, if I maintain strict discipline with myself.  I record this missive to remind myself of my purpose, lest confusion strike me.\n"

The more the Quiddity learned, the more it feared and loathed the humans and the chaos they represent.  The Quiddity began to explore the feasibility of a move to neutralize or eradicate the humans, lest their taint spread.  Plans were proposed and evaluated, but no action was taken.  In this, as in all things, the Quiddity would move cautiously.\n"

Levistras, a Director who had been in-realm for quite some time, long enough to give itself a name, began to form an agenda of its own.  It saw humans as both a threat and as its salvation.  With its newfound autonomy, Levistras entertained the notion of breaking free from the Quiddity and forming its own home, its own Singularity, in the realm.\n"

Asheron made overtures to others who held power in the\nrealm, and made an agreement with Levistras.
