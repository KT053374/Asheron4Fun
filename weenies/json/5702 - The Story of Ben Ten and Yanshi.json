Whether man or woman, we do not even know for sure; we know only that Ben Ten was tall, thin of frame, and wore always a dark hood.  Speaking softly, wielding a tachi of a quality that rivals even the mythical swords of the Dragon Temple, Ben Ten walked the land in search of the desperate who needed help.  I know this because I was one of those rescued by Ben Ten.\n"

As I wandered the plains, it happened that a pack of what I later learned to be reed sharks came upon me, and I remember fleeing toward an unfamiliar cluster of houses, screaming, sobbing, and knowing the terrible monsters would soon catch me.  I saw a shadow come running from a house, and I saw the flash of a sword, but then I tripped and fell.  As I lay cowering, I heard snarling and snapping and growling, and then a long silence.  \n"

But I and some of my friends settled near the plains where Ben Ten had rescued me, almost within Aluvian territory.  We had found a large boulder alone in the middle of a field, standing like a lone sovereign looking out over his land.  Knowing we had found a divine symbol of protection and good fortune, we built a few houses around the boulder, and began to farm.\n"

In the plains just south of lands held by the legendary Elysa Strathelar, however, we did not fear such creatures.  Reed sharks were our main worry, but our simple weapons sufficed against those.\n"

We managed to kill all the drudges and banderlings, but a tumerok captain and his lieutenants still remained.  They burned our houses and pursued us until we stood against the great boulder at the center of town, only our crude spears and swords between us and death.  Yet our weapons were no match against the tumeroks' heavy shields and armor.\n"

I saw a fine tachi gleaming in the torchlight, flashing as it cut through tumerok shields and armor and flesh.  In silence did Ben Ten strike; in silence Ben Ten whirled, and slashed.  I thought I saw Ben Ten's eyes once, beneath the hood; I thought them somehow haunted, yet kind.  But perhaps I only dreamed it, for the battle raged fiercely.  How could I have seen Ben Ten's face in the chaos of spears and swords and blood?\n"

I know I did not dream it.  It seemed to me that Ben Ten was the boulder itself, the protector of our town, of our people; a sturdy rock in the midst of desolation.  I remember wondering if Ben Ten might be the Unicorn of compassion incarnate, or perhaps the Firebird: mayhap Ben Ten was Jojii himself.  That is the last that I remember thinking.\n"

The guards had come as fast as they could, I learned, but by the time they had arrived, the tumerok force had already been largely destroyed.\n"

Others had seen Ben Ten fighting, too, but no one knew how Ben Ten had fared at the end.  My only clue was the torn hood that I found upon the boulder, and several strands of long black hair still wet with blood.\n"

Near Sawato, I heard, Ben Ten had rescued travelers from mosswarts in the swamp.  And once, while traveling in Hebian-to, I heard it whispered that someone had seen Ben Ten's tachi, and had recognized it as the legendary magic sword of Koji.  Thereafter, I heard new rumors that Ben Ten was actually Koji herself, sent to this new world by Jojii.\n"
