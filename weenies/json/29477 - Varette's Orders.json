Bring a hundred strong swords with you to the Ruschk ice fortress at 87.3N, 51.8W . Surround the portal to make sure Oswald has no escape. You yourself are ordered to go into the fortress with as many men as you see fit to arrest and capture Oswald. Bring him to our most secure prison, on the Isle of Ruin.\nDo not fail me as your cousin Lugo did, Captain."
