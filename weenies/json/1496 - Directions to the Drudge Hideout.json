We don't bother them, and they don't normally bother us. But I hear that lately a bigger, bolder drudge boss has moved in, and he's has been leading the other drudges on raids against local farmsteads. No good can come of that.\n\nI also have heard there are some pretty tasty treasure chests in there.\n"
