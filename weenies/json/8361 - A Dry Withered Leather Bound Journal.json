We were then set upon a group of Banderlings intent on doing us harm.  The Mosswarts apparently managed to kill  the attacking Banderlings, although at grievous harm to themselves.  I had thought everything had quieted down, when a new and even larger group of Banderlings were sighted to the east of us and approaching us fast.  The Mosswart leader immediately shouted out a string of orders,\n"

Running.  Always running.  I had liked to think that I was in a shape befitting an active Explorer of the Society.  These Mosswarts disabused me of that notion.\n"

What this rock's purpose is, or where it had come from I had no idea.  But when our groups combined the Mosswarts held up the rock in triumph, even though it took ten of them to do it.  And those Mosswarts who had taken Banderling scalps now threw them up in the air, and there was much shouting and rejoicing.\n"

He then proceeded to put it back in his pack, and the entire group proceeded to enter the Maze. \n\nObviously the cloth is some kind of token for these Mosswarts, of what kind I could not say.
