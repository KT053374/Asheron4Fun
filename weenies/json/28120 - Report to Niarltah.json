Our first efforts to understand the language were failures, later pages have proven easier for the spirits to understand. With time they have been able to decipher the first pages. I have included a large amount of the book that we have managed to decipher thus far.\nIkakhe\n\n"

Alone it wondered at the others that it must know, the others which hung above in scatter specs of light across the sky above and it wondered at what it was missing so far removed from them. The Sleeping One felt the wonder grow within itself and decided that it must not be alone.\n"
