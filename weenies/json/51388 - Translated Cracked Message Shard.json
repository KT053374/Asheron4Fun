Raising the Tumerok to enlightenment has far greater benefits than twisting them into blood-hungry savages to use as pawns.\n\nThe specimen has an adequate understanding of the mystical arts and appears to aspire for further knowledge and guidance. Early tests point towards these creatures being worthy of enlightenment, but more study must be invested.\n\nI remain confident the Tumerok race is a sufficient candidate and future tests will continue to increase the intensity.
