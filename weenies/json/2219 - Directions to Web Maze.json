Even now you can find remnants of their nests, like the Web Maze dungeon, way to the East of here at the base of a hill.  Nowadays it no longer has Olthoi (only a tribe of drudges), but you might get a feeling for how the earliest human arrivals felt when they had come to this land and were enslaved in those dark corridors.  Oh, and beware - once you enter, you will not be able to come out whence you came!  Some, however, find this convenient.\n\n"
