They live, for the most part, in the Linvak Mountains in the southernmost reaches of the island, but rogues and scouts have been sighted in dungeons elsewhere. Lugians are determined, single-minded fighters. Their substantial fists, and even more dangerous weapons, can crush a common Isparian with a single blow."
