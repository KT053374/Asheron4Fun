The destructive power of the book is too strong. \n\nThe means to pass these wards and enter the castle has been entrusted to three guardians. Each champion holds a brand which, when used in succession, will mark the recipient as a defender of Mhoire Castle. The castle defenders can open the way into the castle. The lich has used the book to strike down these champions. At this point I do not think we can muster further defenders, but I record these days as I can so we are not forgotten.\n\n"

Although I was not entirely successful, the spirits of the champions have been drawn inside the enchanted jewel to steal them away from oblivion at the hand of the lich. Although I can call forth the champions by using the jewel at the site of their demise, I fear to summon those spirits for I know they were corrupted before I could save them.\n\nThe first brand was entrusted to Lady Saliane. Lady Saliane was trapped in an open tomb within the graveyard by the lich and obiterated by magic. She retreated into the tomb from the upper graveyard, not far from the entrance to my lord's own tomb.\n\n"

Lord Hendrel called forth mighty magics to strike the lich when they met at the far end of the ranger-lord's forest, but the book reflected his own magic back upon him and sealed his fate.\n\nThe final brand was entrusted to Lord Trimere. Lord Trimere was one of Lord Mhoire's own personal guard. He fought on a parapet of Mhoire Castle while it still flew above the lands. His strength was drained by the consort of the lich, and his still living form was hurled from the castle wall to destruction in the rubble below.\n\n"
