He is puzzling over the rune transcriptions as I write this - turning the sheets this way and that as Ion roasts a rabbit on a spit, and Luma meditates. I am certain that we will begin the final leg of our journey shortly. I am excited, but - oh, to be enjoying the hearth at the Twin Auroch tavern again! As we've traveled, I would swear it's become colder. Perhaps Palomar's cold protection spells are simply wearing thin.\n\n"
