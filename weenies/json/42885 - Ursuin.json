Some people have taken to naming the different breeds of Ursuin by the territories they have migrated to. Only time will tell what impact this carnivore will have on the ecosystem of Dereth."

They stand anywhere from three to seven feet tall at the shoulder, though there are rumored to be even larger species.

The Ursuin are natives of Ispar; however, this does not curb their aggressive tendencies towards other Isparians... or anything else for that matter."
