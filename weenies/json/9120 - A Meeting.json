Both Master and Jean had left me their final instructions, with strict warnings about the means they possessed to facilitate me should I stray from my mission or fail to complete it.  Around me Tuskers grunted and sweated as they bore litters upon which were heaped huge mounds covered in cloth.  A spindly leg or claw occasionally hung down from the side of the mounds.  The Tuskers paid no notice to me as they went back and forth into the dark caverns.  \n"

If they wanted to kill me, they could.  \"Turn\" said a whisper in my mind, and I recognized the voice as the Overseer who had stopped Jean for discussion a few weeks ago.  \n\nI remembered what Jean and Master had said would happen to me if an Overseer or Director had discovered how I had been empowered, and it was a credit to my recent training that I did not quaver openly.\n"
