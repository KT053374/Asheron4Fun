Already a powerful mage as a young man, he was present when the Council of Five -- including his mother Lady Maila -- imprisoned Bael'Zharon the Hopeslayer.

Since the defeat of that Queen, Asheron has worked with High Queen Elysa for the betterment of all Isparians on Dereth. At the same time, he seeks a way to return us to our home world -- and bring his countrymen home from their long exile.\n"
