The Essence Chamber is inaccessible once the Harbinger's link to them is broken by the Nullification Barrier the potion creates.\n\nTravel to Old Yanshi and gain access to the Tunnels of the Harbinger by talking to the two creatures that control the portals. Our Agents report a series of Essence Chambers that the Harbinger has trapped the Essences in. Find these chambers and destroy the Essences.\n\nUse the decanter on their Crystallized Essence remains to obtain the samples I require. Return to me with all four of the samples and I will reward you for your assistance.\n"
