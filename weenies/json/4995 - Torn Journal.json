Fidisa managed to pick the lock of the door near the cavern mouth, and with the rope from my pack, we all rappelled down the sheer drop-off afterwards. The Gelidites did indeed go to great lengths to protect their privacy!  And the walls, embedded with brilliant blue crystals, give off an eerie glow as if they possessed an energy all their own.\n\n"

We dispatched them, but Fidisa caught a mortal blow during the melee, and the hideous creatures dragged her corpse away before we could act.
