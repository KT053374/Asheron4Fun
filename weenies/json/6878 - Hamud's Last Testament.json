I am unable to leave my chambers in this ancient, cursed fortress.  I know now what will become of me.  The Dark Master himself spoke to me and told me what lies in store.   I know I will never reach the gardens of delight spoken of by ibn Salayyar.  In my years of service with the Zharalim, I became familiar with many horrors, but what awaits me now surpasses even the depraved rites of the Milantans.\n"
