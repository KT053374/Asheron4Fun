You have been thrust into a land fraught with dangers and challenges around every turn. Our Explorers are visiting the length and breadth of Dereth to examine its creatures and wildlife.  If we cannot leave Dereth, then we will make it our own.\n"

Throughout the civilized lands of Osteth we have scattered official Red and Gold Letters amongst the hostile creatures that our young adventurers are most prone to encounter. Occasionally these creatures will leave behind a Red, or perhaps even a Gold Letter.  Acquiring the possession of such a letter is only the first step, however.\n"

They have hidden their official town stamp in dungeons near each of their towns. Find the Town Stamp and use it on your Red or Gold Letter.  This will create a Stamped Red or Gold Letter, marked with the name of the town whose stamp you used. Take this Stamped Letter to one of the Agents and exchange it for a reward.\n"

Keep in mind that in order to encourage exploration and give you experience in using the Town Network, which many of us use to travel around Dereth, Society Agents will no longer accept letters from their own towns!\n\nTurning in red stamped letters will yield an Amateur Explorer reward while gold stamped letter will yield a more powerful Seasoned Explorer reward. We created these rewards in the hope that they will aid you in adapting and eventually thriving in your new home.\n"
