And I certainly don't like it, but these things are in here now. These monsters are in my brain, and they won't get out!\n\nThey call themselves the Ruschk. That much we got right. But what we never understood was just how powerful - and how intelligent - they really are. They cannot speak our language. They barely seem to have a language of their own. But somehow they can open your mind and steal every last secret you thought was safe from the world."

I don't know if they are looking to recruit allies or if they're just in it for the sport, but if they have given you this note, then they want you to battle the spirit of their ancient god Tursh. Somehow, they've found a way to allow this god to possess the body of their greatest warrior, a Ruschk they call Kresch.\n\nI don't know what Tursh really is. I don't know if he actually is a god or if he's just some long-dead Ruschk who refuses to leave this plane of existence. I don't know, and I don't much care. All I know is these fiends have taken me captive. And captive I will remain until I have done whatever other tasks they bid of me."
