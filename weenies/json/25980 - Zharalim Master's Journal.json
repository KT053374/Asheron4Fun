This provided us easy access between the tower and the bridge and some modicum of comfort. The banderlings across the valley have grown interested in our work here, but none of them are a serious threat to our efforts.\n\nThe staircase surrounding the tower has fallen into disrepair, so our efforts have been delayed.  Yalik suggested casting ropes to the top of the tower and scaling the walls. This is likely the approach we will take.\n"

Many of the doors on this level were locked or closed to us initially, but the use of our ways opened the rooms for our comfort. The lower areas of this tower are dank and smell of heavy mildew. \n\nThis tower has not kept well, and moisture has leaked into the lower levels, damaging many of the artifacts we sought to investigate.\n"

On the other side there was a glowing shrine, much like those Festival Stones found across the land. A small winged creature charged him as he neared the obelisk and stung him. The area around the wound instantly gangrened. By the end of the day his skin had blackened in several locations and he passed on shortly there after. As it stands right now, I have no idea if he returned to his lifestone.\n"

Only one returned and his report was most grave. Deposits of living soot were discovered slithering across the floor, shadows reached out and attacked as if they had a life of their own, and our trio of informants were kneeling before the obelisk we discovered.\n"
