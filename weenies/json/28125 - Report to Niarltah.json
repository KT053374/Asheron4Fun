It appears that this book is a record of all the knowledge of the mucor on the Burun homeworld.\n\nIkakhe\n"

The Fiazhat are unprepared for the ensuing war as they have fought amongst themselves for so long.\n\nMuch of Fiazhat culture is stricken a terrible blow. But it is saved as the swamps are suddenly filled with moar and the Burun are forced to move on and defend their homes.\n"

The Surface dwelling Burun are forced to exist on smaller creatures. They are free of the moar, but their diet diminishes and they evolve into lither creatures. The mucor are drawn beneath the world and the little magic that the Burun of the surface can muster is a pale comparison to what they once commanded. They live in fear and fight a losing war against the Fiazhat for the next one thousand cycles.\n"
