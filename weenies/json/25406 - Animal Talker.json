She would climb the mystical trees, or swim in the crystal waters of the Blessed Lake from morning to night, then come home to learn how to cook chicken the way her mother did. She was reading before her third birthday and writing soon thereafter. Though these seemed to be quite a gift amongst themselves, her truest gift was her touch.\n\nAadillyah's father, Coman ibn Rath, was a farmer who lived his life in peace. He grew cabbage and carrots, raised rabbits and \n"

He was a happy man, and together with Aadilyah's mother Nassriah, he helped to nurture his daughter's talents. \n\nAadillyah's gift first shone during a great storm that shook the mountains and flooded the rivers. \n\nTuka was frightened as the storm raged all around, and her bleating could be heard even above the thunder that clapped across the night sky. Aadillyah cried, as poor Tuka whimpered and kicked and ran circles in the barn. \n"

The barn door was open before Coman had realized that Aadillyah had run by.\n"
