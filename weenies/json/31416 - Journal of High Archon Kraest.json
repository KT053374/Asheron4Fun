The books I have discovered on my journeys across Dereth have been of great aid, but now my time is pressed.\n\nThe Knights of the Golden Flame, long our bane both here and upon Ispar, have formed a subset calling themselves Shadow Hunters. Even now I am certain one of these hunters is gathering aid and putting the pieces of my plot together."

A voice from the deep called out in my dreams, telling tales of a malevolent force governed by the darkness and trapped within devices stolen from the Falatacot. It spoke to me, beckoned that I free it and bring about a new dark age. It sounded so much like my lord, the Hopeslayer, but it was not. It was weaker, savage and without a path to follow. But it would be folly to ignore such a summons, folly to ignore the pleas of an ally, of a puppet to control.\n\nAs it spoke to me, the shadows lifted from"

Tall with a narrow face and striking eyes. It told me of the wrongs done to it and what it had in turn done to right them.\n\nAnd then, it convulsed and sloughed off its first skin, the skin of the Mukkir. Gone was its familiar form and in its place stood an abomination. A wretched, hunched creature with a set of four arms, each ending with a hand adorned with cruel"
