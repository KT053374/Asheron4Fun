If you seek the way to the terrible blighted Halls of Lost Light, you should start your journey at the intersection of the two northernmost Gharu cities in Osteth. An intersection of cities, you ask? Use your head! Seek south of the capitol and west of the home of my friend Janda Sulifiya. \n"

But beware, beware -- even if you survive the journey through the Carved Cave to the Halls of Lost Light, you had best make some provision for your journey home, for you will not survive the walk back ...\n"
