Arranging my hiking gear into my packs and trading my heavier wool wear for something more fitting of a shoreline stroll, I left Haliana and walked east along the coast.\n\nAfternoon soon fell upon me and my stomach rumbled with hunger. I sat upon a dune and began to prepare a hearty ration or two. As I did this, I heard a rumbling coming from out to sea. The weather out to sea must be fierce."

I carelessly wandered the edge of the shore when a great winged beast rose from the surf and beached itself in front of me.
