It seems to be a repository of a great number of Empyrean artifacts. There was a Golem there, standing guard over a room full of necklaces, but before I could approach the Golem, I was assaulted by a wave of Sclavus. I am pretty sure there was some kind of twisted Falatacot directing them. After they drove me off, they went after the Golem. I do not know what became of the Golem after I left. If you are curious, the vault is located at 52.5 N, 38.9 E."
