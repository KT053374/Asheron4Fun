I have found that your child has a great destiny he must yet fulfill. It will not wear easily on him. Nor, I fear, shall it pass lightly on our long-suffering world, or for a generation of children born far beyond the fields we know. All shall be broken before it is accomplished. Yet this is what must be. Light moves in fashions we cannot fathom. We can simply trust.\n"
