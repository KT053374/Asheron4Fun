If a large enough hide could be found, it is possible you could even make pants out of it.  Bring whatever you find to your local leather crafter.  I'm certain he can do something with it.\n"

The sages I have shown it to say that it could be a result of the cold, but one way or another I know a useful item when I see it.  As of yet, I've been the only person able to do anything with these Wisp hearts, but trust me when I tell you that they are certainly worth it, especially to those Asheron imitators.  If you find one, bring it to me up in the Bandit Castle, and I'll help you out.\n"

Maybe they can teach those mattekars a thing or two, and lead by example.  Their coats are getting thicker for the winter, and as a result you can now occasionally find a coat that is worthwhile to strip and bring to a leather crafter.  You can make all sorts of armor out of the hides, eventually competing with the Mattekar coat for protection.\n"
