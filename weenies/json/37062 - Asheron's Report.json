He has set up a series of gate structures on the Obsidian Plain to channel the exposed energies there.\nYou must gain access to these gates somehow. I believe you will find a device of Virindi construction within. The fluctuations in the ley lines tell me Aerbax is using a mixture of raw planar energy and the dark energies to power his Gates. If you can feed his device enough excess dark energy you may be able to destabilize it and then destroy it, thus shutting down that Gate.\n"
