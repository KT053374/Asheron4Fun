Along with my nephew Ardry I have observed numerous creatures both humanoid and less so. I had intended to dedicate a great deal of time to the study of the creatures called Mosswarts, but our rivals in the Dereth Exploration Society were quicker than I and sent an agent to observe their society.\n"

Apparently the recent appearance of Burun in the Blackmire Swamp has affected Mosswart society even more greatly than we had surmised. According to Bleeargh, entire packs of Mosswarts are fleeing the swamp with the Burun at their backs. Any stragglers are killed. Most of the packs may be headed south towards their \"cousins\" - I surmise that this may refer to the altered Mosswart societies on the Vesayen islands. \n"
