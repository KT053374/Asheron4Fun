Not if you've been paying attention, anyway.\n     The valley will end in a box canyon, with Eotenstoth on your left. In the canyon, you'll find a portal marked \"Land of Bandits\". This would be a fine place to turn back, if you're having second thoughts. No one will hold it against you. They might laugh and call you gutless, but can you really blame them?\n"
