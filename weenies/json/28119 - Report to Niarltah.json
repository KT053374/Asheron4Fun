We've spent the better part of the evening translating the missive and have included the translation of that document below. We also have discovered a large book that the shaman carries. It appears to be covered in a thick rind of fungus. How it has remained overlooked or out of sight for as long as it has is beyond us.\n"

The Guruk have made their way to this world, it can only mean that the Kukuur are not far behind. The Guruk must have been ordered to this world from our home. Without the direction of the Kukuur they will revert to their savage ways. We are no match for their strength and if they are allowed to tap their savage natures we will be culled like the mubur root.\n"

We must move more quickly, brother, the Kukuur will see us destroyed if they are allowed passage to this world.\n"
