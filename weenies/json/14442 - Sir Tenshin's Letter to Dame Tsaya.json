I have had reports that a farmer living on the outskirts of town had recently been acting extremely strangely-acting genially towards his customers one minute, then shouting and berating them in the next. What's more, he claimed to have come into a large inheritance-which is odd, because everyone in town  knows his parents remained in Ispar.\n"

However, a large cache of weapons was found behind a hidden doorway as well as stacks of Guard uniforms.\n\nNow I ask you, Tsaya, how could this farmer store such a large arsenal and obtain these obviously stolen uniforms? There must be breach in our security-above all, I fear for our Queen.\n\nWhat's more, Sir Rylanan has just sent me a letter of recent events in Holtburg. In my\n"

I have recently been keeping surveillance on one of the newer citizens of this town-a \"reformed\" bandit from Marae Lassel claiming to have turned over a new leaf. It appears that this stranger is not as he claimed. A note found in his possession implies that he was employed to transport a cargo of some sort of substance being collected in the depths of Asuger Temple.\n"

I cannot fathom the purpose of these spherules-thinking better of performing my own analysis, I have sent the object to the Arcanum for examination. It would be best to get to the heart of this matter without delay.\n\nWith regards and congratulations for your\nlatest promotion,\n--Rylanan\n"
