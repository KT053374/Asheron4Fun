        "pageText": "Dear friend,\n\nI apologize for the cryptic nature of my communications, and for any trouble you might have had in tracking me through the notes I have left with my servitor Golems. This is the best way I could think of to leave a trail for my friends to follow, while shielding my activities from our enemies. I have taken the strange step of encoding notes in a cipher, using a technique that Prince Borelean employed while he was playing pretend games of Spymaster and Find the Traitor as a young boy. It is a simple letter-shift cipher. The key to decode the cipher can be found with Felscuda, the groundskeeper in service to Lady Folthid. I have written the texts in the Roulean language and alphabet commonly spoken among humans."

        "pageText": "To decode my notes, start with the cipher text I provide here and match each letter, in sequence, against the numbers supplied in my note, \"Ruminations on Portal Creation\". Shift the letter in the cipher text down the alphabet in a number of steps equal to the number it is paired with. For example, a D matched with 3 should be shifted down three spaces to get the \"true text\" G. If a shift takes you down past Z, the last letter in your human alphabet, simply start counting again at the beginning, with A. So if the letter W is paired with the number 5, count down five steps to the letter B."
