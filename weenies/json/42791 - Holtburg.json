Settlers erected it in 2 PY (Portal Year, time dating from the year humans overthrew Olthoi rule), having struck out into the wilderness from the safety of nearby Cragstone to log the vast Tiofor Wood to the west. The town has since become a major waypoint for travelers, as it stands between the villages surrounding Lake Blessed and Glenden Wood, with the Gharu'ndim settlements beyond. "
