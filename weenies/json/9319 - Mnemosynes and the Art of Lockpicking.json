He approached me quickly and quietly, and I readied two of my blades underneath my jerkin.  I would not go down easily.\n\nHe stopped a few feet away.  An odor of sea and death wafted across my nose.  I had been to the sea once, after my first blade job some thirty years back, to avoid further complications.  With the heaving and the smell, I had almost wished I had been caught and hanged.  My grip on the daggers tightened.\n"

When I am offered too much money for a job, it means one of two things, either the man plans on killing me after the job is done, or the man is a fool.  This walking horror was no fool.

He was always arrogant and condescending, but never more so than when he talked about his precious Mnemosynes and how they would save the Dericost.

Of course, what good keys that any \"fledgling\" newly arrived in this world could obtain?  This was the reason why he had contacted me.
