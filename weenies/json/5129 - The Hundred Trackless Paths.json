The evening clouds over the darker limb of the land muttered and answered each other in blue and white flashes.  Ma'yani floated along the courses of the river, the sky filling with jewels beyond the ken of any Malik.  The greenery dropped away, and the face of the brown water was sprinkled with fine dust, and Ma'yani knew then that this was the edge of the great Naqut, which divides the land of Milantos from the decaying Roulean Empire.  Here it was that the people known as Gharu'ndim lived and live.\n\n(more)\n"

On the bank sat a traveler, who dipped a skin into the river, filled it, and brought it to his lips.\n\nAs he sat, drinking, a pillar of steam erupted from the ground, and demon Hayyaz stepped out of the steam, and was the steam.  The traveler looked upon the form of the demon, but merely continued to drink.\n\n(more)\n"

From the shadowed doorways, the lost eyes of children and women reflected torchlight.\n\n'Indeed,' said the traveler, 'if this water is yours, then I have truly done you wrong.'\n\n'It is mine,' said the demon, 'and I do not yet see the back of your neck.'\n"

And at that, he doused the demon Hayyaz with the water from his skin, and with a terrible cry, it was no more.\n\nThe traveler then sat beside the stream again, and drew more water into his skin.  'Now,' he said, 'I have earned it.'  So saying, he drank deeply of the river.\n"
