Little is known of this new ally aside from their tenacity and penchant for killing Mosswarts and their name, Burun. They have already found their way onto the world and have forced aside many of the Mosswarts who once made the Blackmire Swamp their home. \n\nTheir efficiency has given us cause to think that the Burun might fill the gap in our triumvirate of power and prove a foil\n"
