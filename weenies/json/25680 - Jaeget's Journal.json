It's not a very fulfilling living, but it pays the maintenance on the cottage my family owns.\n\nWhile out there, we came across someone claiming to be a representative of the Order of the Raven Hand. He spoke highly of his brothers and of his master and even gave us a pamphlet to bring back to our cottage. \n"

I have to admit that sounds a deal more satisfying than how my brother and I are living now.\n\nBewren openly protested the thought of joining the Raven Hand. He said it was a rash decision, and that there were organizations like it on Ispar and they were hardly alliances of good. I don't believe him, I consider myself a good judge of character, and this Initiate of the Raven Hand made me feel nothing but safe.\n"
