Bigger spines, like those from Shore or Freshwater Armoredillos, would do more damage but be slower on the swing. For some reason, Sandy and Freshwater seem to make more offensive weapons, while Bronze and Shore lend themselves to defense. The largest spines -- from Island, Hoary, and Plate Armoredillos -- would make excellent blades but require the wielder to have a good familiarity with axes.\n"
