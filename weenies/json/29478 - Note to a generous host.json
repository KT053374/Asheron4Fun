I would dearly have loved to meet your King face-to-face again, but I'm afraid he wants to do something terrible to me. I believe the stubborn ass just has not gotten over my attempted assassination of his father. I tried to explain that it was nothing personal, just a matter of business, but he has taken it quite personally. Please convey my sincerest regrets to your humorless tyrant."
