They sought shelter within the walls of Bandit Castle, where MacDugal and his band had lived for some time, but some disagreement split their ranks, and a number of them trekked down the road and wound up at Foster's Fort. A woman called simply Neydisa led their ranks. She saw a grand palace in what looked otherwise like a ruined husk."

Foster, then a new arrival, had been fleeing the Olthoi for days when he glimpsed these spires in the distance. Initially elated, his joy turned to deep disappointment when he found the walls undefended and no one within. He spent years hiding here in the towers until the liberation came, and thereafter vowed to never return to such a forsaken place."
