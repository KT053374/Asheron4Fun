The Mosswart guards are agitated, although they seem to be ignoring me for now.  The din of the battle below is constant and loud.  And it is getting closer.  I had never seen Banderlings and Mosswarts fighting amongst themselves before today, and I had never heard of such instances in the Society meetings.  It will be a good story to tell when I get back.  And it will be a \"when,\" not if,  in this strange world.\n"

Unless, one day, it changes...but useless for me to think of that now.\n\nI had journeyed to this Mosswart stronghold to observe what I could of their lives and habits.  The Society had heard rumors of some bands of Mosswarts heading westwards, but these had remained as yet unconfirmed.\n"

All attempts at civilized contact have resulted in casualties for one side or the other.\n"

It was no small feat as the swamp seemed a living thing, intent on invading and festering  underneath my clothes.  I was covered in muck and mire, every step I made was swallowed by the grasping wet ground, and I stank of things wet and rotting.  At first I thought this would help me, as visually I blended into my surroundings, and the mud softened my footfalls. \n"

I was prepared to take a few of these creatures with me, but before I had time to react, I had been disarmed and surrounded by their long spears.  Seeing as how the spears made no further encroachment upon my neck, I was content to remain unaggressive, though very afraid.  A strange reaction.  What am I afraid of?\n"
