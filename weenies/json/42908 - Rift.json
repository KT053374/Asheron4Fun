Some people believe they are \"intelligent portals\" that have taken umbrage at the superabundance of portal magic use in Dereth. Others believe they are Virindi in their true form, a theory supported by the mask that floats in the light surrounding the Rift. Either thesis could be valid; certainly the Rifts are not answering any questions. They also have the ability to summon Virindi and Virindi-allied creatures to aid them in combat. This last ability is what makes them dangerous."
