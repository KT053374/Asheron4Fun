Recently, their hides have begun to thicken, resulting in the occasional shreth hide, which is useful in making armor for your hands and feet.  If a large enough hide could be found, it is possible you could even make pants out of it.  Bring whatever you find to your local leather crafter.  I'm certain he can do something with it.\n"

Now they've gone and adapted to the summer too!  Their coats are all soft and wonderful now, and even better for skinning, if not as padded as the winter ones were.  Hope they don't keep going at this rate.  Soon they'll stand on their back legs and start asking for a Portal to Teth with the rest of us!\n"
