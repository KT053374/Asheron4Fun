The first Matriarch of the Order was Kerelinas, a member of the Parhelic Sisterhood. It was Kerelinas, with her abhorrence of combat, who first made a habit of coming before the Empress daily and begging to be relieved of her charge. To this day, the head of the Order maintains this tradition. This reinforces the humility of our leader, and recognizes that it is our greatest wish to never be called upon.\n"
