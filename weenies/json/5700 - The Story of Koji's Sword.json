An old man and woman lived near the shrine, taking care of it, and offering daily prayers.  They had one daughter named Koji, whom they had trained to be kind, gentle, and a master of the wooden sword (for they could not afford a real sword).  It was well known that winged sea serpents lived in the ocean nearby, and would occasionally come up onto land and, in the form of human beings, would trick people, kill them, and eat their livers.\n"

Oh, if only we could afford a real sword, like those we used to have before we became poor!\"\n"

This, she saw, was Farmer Tan, a farmer from the other side of the island.\n"
