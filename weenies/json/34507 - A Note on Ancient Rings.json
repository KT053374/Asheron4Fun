Bear with me a while longer - I must ensure that my tracks are well hidden from those who wish ill for me, for our friends, and for Dereth. The numbers you will need to decode this second cipher are in the possession of the Golem Warden in one of the Halls of Metos."

The resulting letter should be the \"true text\" that will tell you which of the many rings in the Northern Storehouse is the true Realaidain heirloom sought by my Portal Servitor."
