For days, the beast slept fitfully, snarling and speaking in an unrecognizable tongue. We were completely at a loss for what it was"

This beast was aware of the Braletain lineage of Haebrous, though what association it had with them is beyond our knowledge.\n\nA fortnight of agitated slumber gave way to a shocking awakening. No sooner had one of our scholars arrived (one whose focus was the recorded history of the Haebrous empire), than had the beast laid waste to a dozen of our bravest skeletons. However, the beast was weakened, hungry, and found no sustenance in our fleshless warriors. It was rapidly subdued"

Our records show that such a being once existed in the lands of Haebrous, though its appearance was more akin to a heavily muscled Haebrean than the scaled creature it now was."

At his queen's behest, Braletain subjected the Spear of Mukkir to life in the gladiatorial pits. As time led on, the Spear of Mukkir gathered an army of slaves and fought their way from the pits and savaged the kingdom, killing many, including Braletain's young wife, Queen Carraida. Days of pillaging and savagery reigned over the city until, without warning or notice, the Spear of Mukkir disappeared."

It is with this that I, ever your humble servant and prefect, request we contain the beast until such a time that we may better control its potential.\n\nThe sisters, from whom we derive our longevity, are known to have once held the means to contain the essences of others within enchanted crystals.
