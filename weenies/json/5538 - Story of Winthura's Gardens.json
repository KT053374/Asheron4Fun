His wife, Lady Winthura, misliked living there, and planted trees in the caves to make her feel more at home.  They disappeared last year, and some whisper of a band of Tumeroks using the abandoned estate for shelter.  North of town, at 44.2S, 25.2E, lies a circle of columns, the centermost one a beacon-light. Travel northwest of this, and you will find the entrance.\n\n"
