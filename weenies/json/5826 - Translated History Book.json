As you all know, Lord Atlan's forces have already been decimated trying to defend the borders. A lone squire survived the battle and he has returned to us with grim news: our children are being kidnapped by some kind of shadow-men. As far as we can tell, the Hopeslayer's forces are infinite. They swirl and shift and continue to grow. The enemy is able to reform and replenish their shadowy ranks far quicker than we can fell them.\n\n(more)\n"

Since their power is too great for the Hopeslayer to ignore, he would surely jump at any chance to wrest control of them from us. Furthermore, Asheron's research has led to the idea that it's possible to construct a crystal that would have the power to trap Bael'Zharon within it. We will, however, face two difficulties in doing this. \n\n(more)\n"

The second issue we shall face is that Bael'Zharon must take hold of the crystal for it to be able to trap him. \n\nAt this point, I ask that despite the dangers of this plan, that we push forward as it seems our last hope. Asheron, for all of our sakes', I pray you are right.\n\n"
