At that time, many valiant heroes fought their way into the vaults of ancient Frore, in hopes of rescuing the lost exploration party of Sir Joffre Tremblant, late of Arwic. Foucault, Ali-Zaboo and the other Orion Hunters, Shao, Keth al-Sheth, and other brave adventurers fought through scores of Gelidite necromancers. In the end, the tortured soul of Sir Tremblant was laid to rest, and The Great Work of the Gelidites,\n\n"

With its destruction, warmth returned to the world.\n\nHere Abrim of Morningthaw recounts the perils he and Kyoujin faced in the bowels of the lost city. The blessings of the Dragon, Firebird, and Unicorn watch over them - over all who descended to the frozen hell of that dread metropolis. Without your sacrifice, we should have faced a still, cold doom. Your names shall be held in honor forevermore, the first champions of a new era in Dereth.\n\n"

I grieved the loss of my friend Kyoujin, his body broken by the denizens of this cold, dark place.  I knew he would be all right, the magic  of the lifestone had captured his spirit, protecting him against true death, but it was small consolation to me as I stood there over his body, wondering how I could go on alone.\n\n"

Together, we sought to bring an end to the bitter winter that blankets Dereth, not fully understanding the danger of this place, and the power of the forces within. Together we fought against the undying guardians of this place, and had won our way into the City. Deeper and deeper we ran, finally coming face to face with Tremblant himself, now transformed into a hideous monster, his dead body reanimated by some evil magic.\n\n"
