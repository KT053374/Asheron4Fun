All the members of the Council - Lord Kerenth of Nesortania, Lady Adja of Ithaenc, Lady Rajael Fellarien, Lord Uweden, Viceroy of Gelid, and Lady Maila of Knorr - were slain while overcoming the Hopeslayer. The Jailne Lyceum was destroyed, and the face Werethas ravaged. \n"

I pray we may never see the need for such foul devices again. We have all of us lost too great and too dear.\n"
