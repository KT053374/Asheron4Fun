For every 3 Reefsharks captured 1 was slaughtered to feed the ravenous Brood Mothers. Of the remaining Reefsharks, 3 out of every 11 were sacrificed to the Whispering One, may he bless us with his wisdom.\n\nKnow the number of Reefsharks left to feed the city and you shall know where to place the staff.\n"
