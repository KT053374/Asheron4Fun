I suppose she though the business would be good there, what with three well-known dungeons in the area. The Cursed Swamp is just a bit northeast, and Dungeon Muddy and the Green Mire Grave are just over the river. But really -- who but a peddler would want to live within smelling distance of the Cursed Swamp? Not me, that's for sure!\n"
