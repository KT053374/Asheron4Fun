I do not often include translation as loose parchment tucked into the tome itself, but my previous dealing with a tome of this nature made me pause to do so. Second, I must apologize that the translation of this tome is merely an educated statement. The language is very different from other Falatacot tomes that I have encountered before, and appears to be a new dialect that I am finding increasingly difficult to decipher. As a result, I can only say that the translation found on these pages is my best guess.\n"

The pages are not brittle as with ancient tomes, in fact they are fairly fresh.\n\nVitriaka makes reference to two types of groups consistently throughout this writing, \"Iakvi Liviliakti\" and \"Tik Vaiktu Kiktij.\" I believe that the references speak of comparison between two races.\n"

I was also able to determine that she was assisted at some point by one of the \"Tik Vaiktu Kiktij,\" though the same creature was not used in the transmogrification process.\n\nThe results of Vitriaka's efforts seem to have ended in failure, as the \"Tik Vaiktu Kiktij\" used in the process apparently died.\n"
