The people of Tou-Tou simply refer to it as the town of the eastern tower, for northeast of town at the tip of the peninsula a massive Empyrean lighthouse extends into the sky, spewing a magical white light that pierces the thickest fogs. Southwest of town along the road leading to Hebian-To, one can find the Tou-Tou Onsen, a traditional Sho bath house built around a natural hot spring."
