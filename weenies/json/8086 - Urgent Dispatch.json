By your command, my Lord Ghere gained entry to the storage facility yesterday, using the arts of the planar mage Saronika. There were no defenders. My Lord Ghere's assumption was that the Yalain were reluctant to leave guardian golems, lest their enchantments serve to give away the facility's location.\n"

The last we saw of her, she cast a plane-slant spell back to the surface, tasked with bringing news of our activity to you. As yet, she has not returned, and it was only this morning that Lord Ghere received your request for information on our progress. A general muster was immediately called, as Lord Ghere expected the Enemy in force at any moment.\n"

I write you now as the most powerful survivor of our expeditionary company. Lord Ghere died quite early in the action, holding at bay several Uvriliim in the upper levels. Our mighty were cut down one by one, although they also took a heavy toll of the Enemy. The dark spawn nearly reached Lord Ghere's post at the base of the facility, whence I now write you. Then, as if by some silent command, all withdrew at once.\n"

As our corpse retrieval parties have recovered our destroyed and lost comrades, they have encountered small groups of the dark spawn, which withdrew rather than engage us.\n"

I do fear we no longer have sufficient force to hold this facility from the servants of the Enemy. I pray you to speed reinforcement, lest the next sally dislodge us utterly. We expect a fresh assault from the upper levels at any moment. I will send this note to you through our last surviving enchanter, Lord Pleridarc of-\n\nI hear now the clatter of renewed combat.
