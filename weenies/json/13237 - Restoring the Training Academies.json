However, I was able to come to an agreement with her whereby the Dereth Exploration Society assumes full ownership of the Academies. \n \nAs you know, this is a great victory for our small society. As new arrivals appear through the portals, we have a chance to teach them the ways of this strange world. The hope, of course, is that these Isparians will fill our libraries with the knowledge they accrue on their adventures.\n"

There are some who feel we should turn our backs on the Viamontians. But the Queen feels - and I agree - that the Dereth Exploration Society should remain a neutral body in this conflict. We have never professed an allegiance to the Queen, nor shall we do so to this Viamontian King.\n"
