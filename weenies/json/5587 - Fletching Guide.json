These are bought in bundles, as are the shafts to make arrows and quarrels.\n\nIf you use arrowheads on arrow shafts, you'll make arrows of the proper sort: armor-piercing arrowheads will create armor-piercing arrows, broad arrowheads will make broadhead arrows, and so forth.\n\nA bundle of arrowheads is enough to make ten arrows.\n\n"

Special oils, created by alchemists, can be used on arrowheads to give them magical powers. Using Frost Oil on a bundle of arrowheads will make them into frost arrowheads, for instance. There is also a particularly potent oil, called Bloodseeker Oil: if you use it on a bundle of arrowheads, it will change them into greater arrowheads, which will do more damage.\n\n"
