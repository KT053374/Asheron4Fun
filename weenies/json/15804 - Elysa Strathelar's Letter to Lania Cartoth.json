Asheron is able to wield forces beyond that which we knew on Ispar. You question- what good is power when its very use brings disaster and pain through unintended consequences?

For your sake and the sake of your little brother I beg of you to leave this matter of seeking proof be! There would be deadly forces to contend with, and I understand the Undead have also inhabited that place. Do not venture there! \n"
