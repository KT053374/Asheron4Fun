I have placed the need of physical goods over the breath that must fill my soul.\n\nI feel like a husk of a man. I am in need of healing and a way back to a life of meaning and depth. I step onto the path of Jojii with cautious feet, mindful that I must have become empty so that I may be filled. I will let the grace of the Unicorn light my feet, the splendor of the Firebird guide my will, and the Strength of the Dragon be my arm.\n\n(more)\n"
