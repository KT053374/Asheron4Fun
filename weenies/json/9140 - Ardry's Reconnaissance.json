Some days ago, whilst exploring the Direlands, I witnessed a strange conference: a Virindi and a Tumerok, staring at each other but exchanging no visible or audible signs.  They were surrounded by several other Tumeroks and servile Drudges. \n"

As if that were not strange enough, the Virindi created a portal, and the Tumerok shepherded his companions through before stepping into it himself.  In a move that, in retrospect, seems rash, I ran through the portal as the Virindi turned away, and found myself here.\n"

One wonders what they have planned!  Having learned as much as I think I can, I am heading south to search for their outpost.\n\nArdry the Dubious\n"
