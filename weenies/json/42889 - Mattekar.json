They are also known, among common folk, as \"snow sharks.\" They are huge -- seven feet or taller at the shoulder -- and are found as lone rogues and small family units: the latter will defend one another to the death. They attack with claws, horns and teeth, and are particularly resistant to damage due to cold. "
