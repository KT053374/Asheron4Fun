For many years, the Queen and her allies had no insight into the totem's function or significance. However, after searching through a series of ancient Empyrean texts, Alatar Locke discovered that Tursh was some sort of being worshipped as a god by a group of cannibalistic savages that once lived in the snow-covered peaks of Dereth. Tursh was purported to be the god of Hunger, though no other reference to Tursh's specific powers or exploits were uncovered in Alatar's research. "
