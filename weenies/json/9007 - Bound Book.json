We were called to the mines in the name of greed and our insatiable desire for a life our ancestors set upon us.  It was as if happiness itself was being mined from the rich veins in those tunnels. Every day we picked and cracked those tunnels open forcing them to reveal their wealth. Our wealth.\n"

When we drank it was from goblets of polished silver. The very essence of the mine oozed itself into our living rooms and we welcomed it as a child lost in the night.\n"

        "pageText": "Then the day came when we forced the mine to reveal much more than the wealth\nit had been hiding from us. Our miners had broken down a wall revealing an ancient tunnel. We assumed the Empyreans erected it long ago, as we had found evidence of their prior existence in the mine before.  In the beginning we expected to find chambers filled with ancient Empyrean riches. Perhaps even relics left behind. But when three seasoned miners didn't return from the tunnels we knew something sinister had happened.\n"

We still had visions of chambers glittering with treasure and rare relics. The following day we had our answer. Only one warrior emerged from the mine's opening, bruised and battered from a battle so fierce it should have left him dead. He stumbled forward and collapsed before our feet. \n"

There were no rooms glittering with treasure. No lost relics from a past civilization. The warrior spoke only of men who death had touched but had not taken. He spoke of rotted and fleshless men who had taken up arms in the name of something unearthly.\n"

It placed a pox upon everyone and everything. Our town coffers dried up, our crops died, and over time even the most stubborn person left town.  Only I remain to tell this story and to warn others from entering the Mines of Despair.\n"
