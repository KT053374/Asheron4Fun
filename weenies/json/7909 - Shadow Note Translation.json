Were I to choose a word that described his every movement and motion, it should be \"rage.\" This be not the motivation of the one I followed into darkness. He showed then a righteous anger, a desire to see our kind treated with justice - not this blind, cruel hatred of all things Yalain. Even now, I feel his black thoughts, and they linger unpleasantly on his plans for them.\n"

The sight of what the Black Breath did to it, and the shrieks of the prisoners as they were grafted to its bones, will never be dislodged from my recollection.\n"

Perhaps we know. Now, it seems, his voice only whispers of wrath and pain, of conquering all and bringing them into the body. This sounds not like the Bael'Zharon I knew in times long past.\n"

They speak too little, and seem to much of a mind for my taste. I wonder indeed what their goals are. Speak not to them of our plans.\n"
