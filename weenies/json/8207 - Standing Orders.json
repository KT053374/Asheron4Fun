I assure you, nothing could be further from the truth. Your presence here is testament to your loyalty, as is what I am about to tell you.\n"

The finest researchers in the world have had copies of their treatises and inquiries deposited in our vaults, in the event that we have need of them in the future. There are in excess of 10,000 volumes currently stored here. To have a work elected for inclusion in the Seaborne Empire's various archives is a source of pride for any academic.\n"

In our underground caverns, nearly any form of plant can be grown. In turn, these plants support a number of animal species. The grottos are Heran's masterwork; you should appreciate them. The first rule of Laeraa is, walk with ranaayai's feet in the grottos. (Translator's note: context indicates \"ranaayai\" may be a stealthy predator animal of ancient Dereth - name means \"inescapable burning.\") Do not leave fires unattended, nor uproot the plants, nor slay the animals. Few have the skill to recreate these fragile treasures.\n"

Slippage is misdirected mana, which may be absorbed by the earth, air, or sea. The Laerauinth are the result of slipped mana concentrating in certain sympathetic crystal deposits. In a sense, they are stones animated by the pure force of magic.\n"

Not in the sense that a bird might, but in that they periodically drop crystalline nodules, containing a portion of their mana, that grow into another of their kind. These growths - eggs, if you will - can be ingested when enchanted properly. They can greatly increase a mage's natural capacity for storing mana. This effect does not last long, however, and there is a critical drawback.\n"

The end result is that the mage's ability to store and wield mana is completely destroyed.

The larger grottos were cleansed through the efforts of Uranten's students, though not without cost. The lowest chambers were adjudged beyond redemption by the Lyceum's masters. It was possible to contain the darkness, to weaken it, but the chambers could not be cleansed.\n"
