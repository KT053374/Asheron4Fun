But I hear that you and your people have prospered, and have a big castle in the north to call home. Not bad! For our part, Onda Nakoza and I found ourselves on a hot and humid island, south of the mainland. 'Tis not a bad place, except for the occasional Mosswart raid. I hope everyone there is doing right. Give Jourgenson a punch in the jaw for me, for old times' sake.\n\n"
