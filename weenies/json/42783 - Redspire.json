One of these settlements is Redspire, a town situated on the southwestern coast of Marae Lassel. In Thistledown of 16 PY, as part of Varrici II's war against the \"Bloodless,\" the three human settlements on Marae were captured under cover of night. Though a fragile truce now exists between Strathelar and Varrici, the three spire towns remain under New Viamont's control."
