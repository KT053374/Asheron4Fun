I suspect the Virindi may have something to do with its present condition; however, I doubt they were the originators of the trouble.  One can see the later Empyrean who lived here - or sought to live here - struggled and ultimately failed to tame the portal magic of this city.  The capricious nature of the portals undoubtedly made this unsuitable for living, for there is not enough energy here to produce adequate food, and the unreliability of the portals would make bringing supplies difficult.\n"

I spoke briefly with Elysa Strathelar yesterday, and the dear lady worried that I might become trapped in this city if I did not leave soon.  I seriously doubt such an accident might befall someone like myself, especially as there seem to be no shortage of portals leading out.  Still, it is clear that I should write these notes today, without delay, lest I not have the opportunity to return and leave my musings for a far distant posterity.\n"
