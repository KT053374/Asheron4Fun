Speak with her and she will teach you how to focus your own Light to build an inner strength that the Oracles call Luminance. Once she teaches you to recognize and empower your own Luminance of the world around you then you may gain Luminance from the most powerful creatures and the most dangerous quests."

You can gather up to 1,000,000 luminance points before you must spend some by training at the Oracles to earn Auras and gain in power. This limit is only the maximum number of points you can accumulate at any one time; once you spend Luminance you are free to gain more, in effect refilling your total as you quest and hunt in the most dangerous areas."

Though all the Seers accept (some begrudgingly) Nalicana's hand in things, they will teach no student who still carries the Aura of a rival Seer. Some say their teachings are opposed in nature. Whatever the reason, you cannot learn from more than one at a time. You may seek guidance and power from any Oracle at any time, but if you accept their teachings, you will lose any Auras you gained from the other, rival Seers. Although all of Nalicana's Auras and teachings will remain with you, students who chose to learn from the four remaining Seers may only learn from one."
