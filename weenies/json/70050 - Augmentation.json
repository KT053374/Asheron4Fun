I watched as Eleonora fell.\n\n\n\nIt did not take them long to find me, cowering amongst the ice-covered trees. I would like to say I put up more of a fight. I would like to say that I tried with all my might to rescue Eleonora and Sir Bellas from King's forces, but I am no soldier. This has always been true of me, and it is true to this day."

My flight from the torture chambers, my escape through the Olthoi tunnels, my harrowing trek through the forests of this new world... It is all due to luck.\n\nWhen they captured me, they took me to their torture chambers. I had heard the stories. I knew of what they were capable. I fully expected to end my days flayed alive or pinned within the iron maiden. But no, they had another fate for me."

I do not know where he came across this ability, and I have no idea how long it took him to perfect it. My capture was... how long ago? Years? Months? I fear I do not quite remember. My mind has not been whole for a long while. I remember fleeing the Olthoi and emerging into the forests of Dereth. But I do not remember how I got there."

She took care of me, nursed me back to health, acted as counselor along with her silent companion Hendac. They listened to my stories, suffered my wailing rants. It is due to the two of them that I am able to function at all.\n\nThough obviously not with the clarity of mind of which I was once possessed. This rambling narrative ought to serve as proof of that."

For weeks, months, they bathed him in the foul magics they had mastered on this world.\n\nHe screamed, oh how he screamed.\n\nThe magics twisted him. They warped his mind as well as his flesh. He was already a large man to begin with, but these magics increased his size fivefold."

They worked on him for months before he exacted his terrible revenge.\n\nI do not know what slip the mages made. I don't know how he was freed from his magical bonds, but I saw it happen. I saw as he realized that he was free. And I saw the mages panic as they realized it, too.\n\nThey tried to re-cast the binding spell, but he was too fast. They made him that way."

I had never heard a skull pop before, and I dearly hope I never have to hear it again.\n\nHe slung the dead mage's body at the others. He was upon them as they fell to the ground, ripping and tearing. Limbs were pulled from sockets, heads from necks. Gone was the skilled, calculating warrior I had served for so many years."

But no, that did not happen. His mind was shattered. He was no longer the brave and noble Sir Bellas. He was now a wild thing, full of bloodlust and savagery.\n\nHe fled the torture chamber. I heard the screams as he tore through the guards above. I heard as he smashed through their cages and escaped our dank prison."

I have also heard rumors that the warriors of this world fight him for sport, pitting themselves against his awesome might. I dearly hope these rumors are false. I shudder to think of the pain he must endure in this state. Perhaps one day I might find him. Perhaps one day I might cure him. Jenavere tells me that her Queen - an Aluvian named Elysa Strathelar - might well aid me in this endeavor. I hope that she will."

Will she treat a coward such as me with kindness and respect? Or will she subject me to the savage justice the Aluvians are known for? Aluvians are but barbarians playing at nobility on Ispar. Or at least, that is what we are told. I finally get to see for myself whether or not this is true."
